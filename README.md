# Strong Noise Limits of SDEs

Motivated by understanding from quantum collapse, this Python code provides simulations for certain stochastic differential equations. The regime of interest is that of strong noise.

- pics/* contains the generated simulations.

- onesDimensionalSpikes.ipynb is a Python notebook focused on one dimensional situations. It echoes [the following paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05629) which deals with the theoretical treatment.

- threeState.ipynb is a Python notebook in progress, for the multimensional setting.
