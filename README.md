# Strong Noise Limits

Motivated by understanding from quantum collapse, this Python code provides simulations for certain stochastic differential equations. The regime of interest is that of strong noise.

- pics/* contains the generated simulations.
- onesDimensionalSpikes.ipynb is a Python notebook focused on one dimensional situations.
- threeState.ipynb is a Python notebook in progress, for the multimensional setting.
